# my_resume 

This repo contains my resume built using HTML, a lot of CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.

## How to run

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages. You can view it [here](https://chesahkalu.github.io/my_resume/).

If you want to run it locally, you can clone the repo and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Updates

I will be updating the resume as I learn more and advance in my career. I will also be adding a blog section to the website soon.
